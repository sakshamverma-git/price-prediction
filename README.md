# price-prediction
I have created a simple machine learning project that demonstrates linear regression using NumPy for calculations and Matplotlib for visualization. This project will predict house prices based on house size using a basic dataset.

This project includes:
Generating synthetic data for house sizes and prices,
Implementing linear regression using the normal equation,
Making predictions,
Visualizing the data and regression line and
Calculating the Mean Squared Error
